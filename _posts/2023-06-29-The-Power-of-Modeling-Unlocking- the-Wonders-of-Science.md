title: "The Power of Modeling: Unlocking the Wonders of Science"
---
Back in 2017, during my time as an engineering student, I had the opportunity to visit the Boston Museum of Science. Little did I know that this visit would profoundly impact my understanding of the world around me. The museum's dedicated section on modeling caught my attention, and I found myself pondering why modeling, something seemingly simple, warranted such a significant portion of the museum. 

It wasn't until later, when I embarked on a Computational Neuroscience Ph.D. course, that I began to unravel the remarkable power of modeling. In this article, I will delve into three key aspects that make modeling an indispensable tool in scientific exploration.

**Encouraging us to think about the mechanism**

One of the primary strengths of modeling is its ability to prompt us to contemplate the inner workings of a system. By breaking down complex phenomena into simpler components, modeling allows us to investigate the underlying mechanisms more effectively. It provides a transition from a holistic perspective to a detailed one, granting us the opportunity to question the intricacies of the system.

- **Shifting the focus to the details**
Modeling permits us to delve into the finer details of a system, enabling a deeper understanding of its intricacies. By asking probing questions about the behavior of individual components, we can gain insights into the overall behavior of the system as a whole. This shift from the big picture to the specifics helps us uncover valuable knowledge that might otherwise remain hidden.
- **Identifying dependent and independent variables**
Another advantage of modeling is its capacity to identify the interrelationships between different variables within a system. By isolating the dependent and independent variables, we can make informed assumptions and simplify the modeling process. This analytical framework allows for more accurate predictions and a clearer understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.

**Encouraging us to observe the environment**

Modeling also acts as a catalyst for enhanced environmental awareness. When engaging in the modeling process, we are prompted to consider whether the mechanisms we are examining are similar to those present in the real-world scenarios we encounter. This prompts a conscious evaluation of the environment and encourages us to connect our models to the complexities of the natural world.

- **Increasing environmental awareness**
As we develop models, we naturally become more attuned to our surroundings. We begin to notice patterns and similarities between the mechanisms we study and those occurring in our environment. This heightened awareness fosters a deeper understanding of the world and its interconnectedness, helping us make more informed decisions and solutions.
- **Cultivating curiosity and questioning**
The act of modeling nurtures an innate sense of curiosity and an eagerness to question the world around us. As we explore different variables and interactions, we often uncover new mysteries that ignite our curiosity. This intrinsic motivation to seek answers pushes scientific progress forward and fuels our desire to unravel the complexities of the universe.

**Providing a foundation for complex mechanisms**

Modeling serves as the bedrock upon which numerous scientific disciplines are built. It has played a pivotal role in shaping various fields, enabling breakthroughs that would have otherwise been unattainable.

- **Hodgkin-Huxley and the birth of Computational Neuroscience**
The pioneering work of Hodgkin and Huxley in modeling the behavior of neurons marked the birth of computational neuroscience. Their efforts to mathematically describe the electrical activity of neurons laid the foundation for a field that has revolutionized our understanding of the brain and paved the way for advancements in artificial intelligence and neural networks.
- **Expanding fields through diverse modeling approaches**
Modeling's influence extends across a wide range of disciplines, with each unique modeling approach addressing different functionalities and contributing to the development of its respective field. Whether it's the simulation of physical phenomena, the economic modeling of markets, or the ecological modeling of ecosystems, each application of modeling brings new insights, advances understanding, and propels the growth of diverse scientific domains.

The Boston Museum of Science's emphasis on modeling sparked my initial curiosity and led me to explore its profound impact. By encouraging us to think deeply about mechanisms, observe our environment, and serve as the foundation for complex systems, modeling empowers us to unravel the mysteries of the world. It fosters a scientific mindset rooted in curiosity and critical thinking, pushing the boundaries of knowledge across various disciplines. As we continue to harness the power of modeling, we unlock new avenues of understanding and pave the way for groundbreaking discoveries that shape our future.
